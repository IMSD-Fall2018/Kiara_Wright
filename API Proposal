Proposal for final Unity project
Idea #1 
Anime character Bio API
I want to make an API that can tell the Bioâ€™s different anime characters. 
On Unity the console it print out the characters name and information about them.
In the scene it I want to display how the character looks like. 
If anyone one is wondering who the character is and what they look like the
console and scene can show them. looking for an API to use is still a challenge. 
But getting started with the Code is what I can do. I do not think I am using real time. 

Cat API
Idea #2 
Almost similar to the anime character bio API idea. 
But with this one it will show images of cats. The scene will show 
the images and the console will say where it is from. https://thecatapi.com 
is where I can get the API. I know how to get the API. 
I am still not sure on how to do the code for this API.
