   I read the article called "The Work of Art in thr Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Walter Benjamin. 
  Walter Benjamin talks about the transition of how art is replicated. Walter brought up the term lithography, 
  which is when pictuers were drawn on stone. With the way pictuers were developed from 
  being drawn on stone to cameras being made. with cameras its much easier to take pictuers rather than drawing
  them out and the process is way faster. As time pass technology started to grow. On page two paragraph 4, Walter talks
  about the word aura. Mechanical reporduction has the aura of a work of art. in which the process over time as art 
  developes. Digital gaming started out as a plan. Meaning that when game developers want to make digital games they would 
  plan it out first, make hand drawn blue prints, transfer the drawings on the computer and refine what they made and finalize it. 
  Not all art can be reproduce the same way but through time it can be remasterd to look better than the first.
